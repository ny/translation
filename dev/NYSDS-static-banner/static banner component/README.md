# NYSDS Static Banner (dismissable)

This is each of the pieces separated out for the translation static banner. You need all of it to exist somewhere for this to work. The html structure of the component, the css to style it, and the js for the close button (or a similar function for that).

Problems? Give us a shout at [digital.services@ogs.ny.gov]

## What is in here?
- nysds-banner.css is the css 
- this-closes-the-banner.js is the super simple js to dismiss the banner when the X is clicked. It needs to exist when the DOM is ready / page is loaded. 
- banner-only-html.html is the html structure of the banner. If you only use this file and nothing else, it won't work.
- nysds-static-banner-demo.html is another demo
